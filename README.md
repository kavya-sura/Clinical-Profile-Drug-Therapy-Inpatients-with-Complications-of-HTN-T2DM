# Clinical Profile, Drug Therapy In patients with Complications of Hypertension, Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Coexistence of both conditions - A Prospective Observational Study

# Background: 
Hypertension (HTN) and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) are the leading causes of various complications in the elderly population. Clinical profile plays a key role in assessing the health conditions of a patient, based on the severity of the complications appropriate drug therapy will be recommended, thus improving the health and quality of life of a patient.

# Objective: 
This study aimed to assess the clinical profile and drug therapy in patients experiencing complications with HTN and T2DM and the coexistence of both conditions.

# Result: 
A prospective observational study was carried out at the inpatient general medicine department of a tertiary care hospital, for 6 months among 180 patients. The most common complications are seen in males (62.96%). Among the study population, 81(33%) cases were found to be CVA, 53(22%) with CKD, and 43(18%) with HF with significant p-values at 0.0007, 0.0032, and 0.0164 respectively obtained by using Linear Regression analysis. 35.22% of Antiplatelets and 22.27% of Antihyperlipidemics were widely used in CVA. The most common complications among the patients were found to be Cerebrovascular Accidents 81(33%), chronic kidney disease 53(22%), and HeartFailure 43(18%) with a significant p-value at 0.0007, 0.0032, 0.0164respectively obtained by using Linear Regression analysis. 35.22% of Antiplatelets and 22.27% of Antihyperlipidemic's were widely used in Cerebrovascular Accidents.

# Conclusion: 
There was a great association between the risk factors and the development of complications. As a clinical pharmacist, the prime responsibility is to provide information regarding the complications and their risk factors to improve the quality of life of a patient with chronic diseases.
